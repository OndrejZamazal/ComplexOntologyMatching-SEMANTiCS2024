        "We provide a description of pattern-based pipeline along with an example targeting the alignment pattern \\emph{Class by Attribute Type} (CAT) [Scharffe09](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_url?url=https://www.academia.edu/download/30806287/manuscript.pdf&hl=en&sa=T&oi=gsb-gga&ct=res&cd=0&d=621239557845776854&ei=9Ut1Zvj6B6aty9YP54e9kAc&scisig=AFWwaeZPfF1N_zmYFPxB4qOSuqY8). This pattern specifies equivalence between a class in O1 and a class in O2 restricted on its scope using existential restriction; in Manchester OWL syntax: *O1:Class1 EquivalentTo O2:Class1 and (O2:property some O2:Class2)*.\n",
        "\n",
        "The pipeline overview:\n",
        "- **Step 1**: Detection is based on a structural aspect (a pair of SPARQL queries).\n",
        "- **Step 2**: Results from detecting both ontologies are joined according to the alignment pattern separately per each input correspondence.\n",
        "- **Step 3**: Pattern-based template-driven verbalization to natural language (English) is applied on complex correspondence candidates to enable their validation using LLM.\n",
        "- **Step 4**: Finally, LLM is used to validate whether verbalized complex correspondence candidates are (probably) positives/negatives.\n",
        "\n",
        "While the Jupyter notebook covers three steps, the fourth step, dealing with prompting LLM, should be straightforward and implemented after further experimentation with other LLMs.\n",
